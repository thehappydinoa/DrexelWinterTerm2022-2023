# SE 211 Assignment #2

## Description

Your assignment is to design and implement a library to handle CSV files. This
library should be designed so that it is worthy of general use. As part of
this assignment, you need to come up with the specification of the
requirements for the proposed library. These requirements should address
issues related to the format of the CSV file, the interface provided by the
library, and error recovery.

## Requirement Specifications

- [ ] The library should be able to read a CSV file and return a list of
      records. Each record should be a list of strings.
- [ ] The library should be able to write a list of records to a CSV file.
- [ ] The library should be able to handle CSV files with a variable number
      of fields per record.
- [ ] The library should be able to detect the field separator character.
- [ ] The library should be able to handle CSV files with quoted fields.
- [ ] The library should be able to handle CSV files with quoted fields that
      contain the field separator character.
- [ ] The library should be able to handle CSV files with quoted fields that
      contain newlines.
- [ ] The library should be able to display a list of records in a human
      readable format.
- [ ] The library should be able to filter the columns of a list of records.

## Tests

The following test cases should be used to test your library:

- [ ] Test case 1: Read a CSV file with a single record and a single field.
- [ ] Test case 2: Read a CSV file with a single record and multiple fields.
- [ ] Test case 3: Read a CSV file with multiple records and multiple fields.
- [ ] Test case 4: Read a CSV file with a variable number of fields per record.
- [ ] Test case 5: Read a CSV file with a field separator character that is
      not a comma.
- [ ] Test case 6: Read a CSV file with quoted fields.
- [ ] Test case 7: Read a CSV file with quoted fields that contain the field
      separator character.
- [ ] Test case 8: Read a CSV file with quoted fields that contain newlines.
- [ ] Test case 9: Write a CSV file with a single record and a single field.
- [ ] Test case 10: Write a CSV file with a single record and multiple fields.
- [ ] Test case 11: Write a CSV file with multiple records and multiple fields.
- [ ] Test case 12: Write a CSV file with a variable number of fields per
      record.
- [ ] Test case 13: Write a CSV file with a field separator character that is
      not a comma.
- [ ] Test case 14: Write a CSV file with quoted fields.
- [ ] Test case 15: Write a CSV file with quoted fields that contain the field
      separator character.
- [ ] Test case 16: Write a CSV file with quoted fields that contain newlines.
- [ ] Test case 17: Read a CSV file with a field separator character that is
      not a comma and write it back out.
- [ ] Test case 18: Read a CSV file with quoted fields and write it back out.
- [ ] Test case 19: Read a CSV file with quoted fields that contain the field
      separator character and write it back out.
- [ ] Test case 20: Read a CSV file, filter the columns, and write it back out.
- [ ] Test case 21: Read a CSV file, filter the columns, and display it in a
      human readable format.
