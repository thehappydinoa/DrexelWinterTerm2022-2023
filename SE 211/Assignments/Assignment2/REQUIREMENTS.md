# Requirements Specification for a Java CSV Library

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for a Java CSV library. The library should be designed to provide functionality for reading and writing CSV files in Java. The library should be designed to be easy to use, efficient, and flexible.

## Features

The library should be able to perform the following functions:

Read CSV files: The library should be able to read CSV files and parse them into a format that can be easily manipulated in Java.
Write CSV files: The library should be able to write data in CSV format to a file.
Parse and generate CSV files: The library should be able to parse CSV files into a structured format and generate CSV files from structured data.
Handle different types of data: The library should be able to handle different types of data, including numbers, strings, and dates.
Handle large files: The library should be able to handle CSV files of any size, including very large files that may not fit into memory.

## Constraints and Limitations

The library should be designed with the following constraints and limitations in mind:

Memory usage: The library should be designed to use as little memory as possible to handle large CSV files.
Performance: The library should be designed to be efficient and fast when working with large CSV files.
Compatibility: The library should be compatible with different operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Integration: The library should be designed to integrate with other Java libraries and frameworks.
User Interface Requirements
The library should not have a user interface, as it will be used as a backend library for other Java applications. However, it should have a clear and well-documented API for ease of use.

## Conclusion

The Java CSV library should be designed to provide an easy-to-use and efficient solution for reading and writing CSV files in Java. It should be flexible enough to handle different types of data and large files while using minimal memory. The library should be well-documented and compatible with different operating systems and Java frameworks.
